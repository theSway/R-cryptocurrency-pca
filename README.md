Project: Hedging against risk in the cryptocurrency market, unconventional PCA using R

Spring 2018, I set out to find out if there was any sense to be found in the deep bear market of cryptocurrencies that had just begun. This was a class project for the course Multivariate Statistical Analysis. I employed a bold strategy for PCA and used discretized time as features: every day on the market would represent a feature for the markets. I hypothesized that if there was any information arbitrage to be had, its existence would be revealed by binning instruments according to daily trading: Bad news in the banking segment on one day could boost the price of crypto payment instruments, while crypto IoT solution instruments would remain unaffected. And so on.

Alas, my PCA revealed nothing, but my analysis was very cursory and there still might be promise in this approach.
